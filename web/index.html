        <p>My name is Trevor Williams. I live in Southern California with my wife and newborn son of 3 months.</p>
        <p>I am very pastinate about learning game developement and not trying to make the
            biggest game ever. But I want to change the way we feel about the interaction and connection we have with
            games.
        </p>
        <p>My current venture is gesture controlled vr games. I struggle with this one as there is no force feedback
            without a controller but new doors open for interaction with our hands free for interpretation. I can't wait to see what I can learn to do and make
            something new and exciting.</p>
